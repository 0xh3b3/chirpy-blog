## Solution
I downloaded the image and it was soo interesting, just strip of random colors, the first thing that came to my mind was, what if I get their hex values, noting the challenge instruction stated that, "...the __numerical__ esscence will __guide__ you to the __flag__..". This itself was the greatest hint and we didn't need any other

So I googled color piker and the first website that come in the results was this

[Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/)

I uploaded the image and I was able to obtain their hex values using the color picker.

I mapped the hex values respectfully as follows

```#6d6d75```
```#637466```
```#7b346c```
```#773479```
```#355f68```
```#316464```
```#336e5f```
```#316e35```
```#64335f```
```#6d337d```

After examining the values for I while, I could not see anything interesting about them, I was expecting a consustent pattern from the values, or something that could capture my intuitive attention ...

Suddenly I had a crazy idea, what if I combine the hex values !!!
Great idea, right? And so I did that, I removed the hashes from the values and arranged the values in their order of appearance, into a one long sequence

```6d6d756374667b346c773479355f68316464336e5f316e3564335f6d337d```

I pasted the results into cyberchef and it automatically I dentified the value as hex, It converted int text and booom!!
