## Solution

I clicked the challenge link and I was redirected to a login/Create account page.

While penetration testing a login page, I usually start with common vulnurabilities that can be found in a login page i.e injections like `xss`, `sqli`, `xxe` and `ldap`

So I tries sqli but it seemed not to be vulnurable. so I created an account with xss payloads but they too were filtered

From the screenshot below you can see tht there is a protection against xss and the dangerous characters are being filtered, there is also no sqli as the sqli characters have no effect.

Ofcourse someone could easily point up blind sqli but I assumed that it too wasn;t there. unless I exhaust all other options then I could come to test for such.

As you can see the id parameter and value is reflected on the url which is a good indication to test for `idor`

Lets start from id 1 since the admin page could be the most interesting and it is most likely to be id 1, anyone familiar with website development and databases will know this.
