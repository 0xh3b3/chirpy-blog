## Solution
The first rule of reverse Engeneering is to check the strings. Strings will give you alot of innitial information, unless obsufcated.
This is a basic Malware analysis beginner stuff.
(More info in the THM room in the resources)

```strings revealme | grep mmuctf```

`Correct! The flag is: mmuctf{r3v3rs1ng_st4rt3r}`

> `mmuctf{r3v3rs1ng_st4rt3r}`
