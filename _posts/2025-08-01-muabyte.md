## Solution
I started by my usual methodology, first verifying the file type with file command, then check the strings.

`strings moabyte.jpg`

On observing the string I noticed that this particular image had interesting strings which was just random numbers, 

    46367531213455729571229272127871897572932836792371223868921227929293928136322523926852279717253549458256481178835732292937714945793829213927325575398953726854975295712931228811739871781314921881149897146367851728238679392815317971135176671139266857113517193281181258571936638968

this was soo interesting, I had to check if it was some kind of a cypher or just a coincidence.

Cyberchef did not give me any usefull results but I gave it a second chance on [dcode.fr Cipher Identifier Utility](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) It immediately identified it as a cipher called Morbit Cipher, The word sounded like the Title, which can be regarded as a hint

I decoded it using the same dcode.fr using the default key provided in the site and I got this

`MORBIT CIPHER IS A VARIANT OF THE MORSE FRACTIONED CODE USING A KEY THAT GENERATES A NUMERIC ENCRYPTION ALPHABETTHEY SAID RUTH WAS MOABITE MMUCTFDU5715C0N574NT4SKN40M1`

Did you see it? (convert into lowercase using Cyber Chef and add tags, common sense ;p)

    WRITERS COMMENTS:

    "Reading the instructions is one of the most important skill in CTFs, most hints are hidden in the challenge instruction or Heading. Do not ignore these two no matter how long and exhausting they may look. The hint from these are better than the actual hint, why waste opoints opening a hint when you have a better one infront of you?"
