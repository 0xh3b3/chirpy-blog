## Solution
Lets fire up our favourite forensic tool `autopsy`, must run with sudo. It has a web interactivity

Using autopsy requires alot of forensics knowledge which I might advice the reader to go through the THM forensics module if they have are not yet familiar with it.

Keep in mind `file systems` in this case since its a usb it is most likely to be __fat32__
